*LinkedHospitality* is a membership created for Hospitality Operators, suppliers and educational institutions in the UK.  Subscribing helps them to grow by staying connected with people in the industry by participating in their events.

This website is B2B, and the target audience is Hospitality operators, suppliers, educational institutions and new companies that want to get their product on the market.

* _Group two_: Suppliers: Food & beverage suppliers/furniture suppliers/venue suppliers/flower suppliers/linen suppliers/Property management systems suppliers.
* _Group three_:  Educational Institutions that offer courses related to Hospitality.
  

**User Stories**

1. _As a user Group one_:

* I want to find out information about the company to determine if they have the expertise I am looking for.
* I want to see what suppliers have subscribed to evaluate whether it will be valuable for my company to join.
* I want to find out what type of events the company organize to know if that aligns with what I want to achieve from the membership.
* I want to find out the dates and location of their events to identify whether I will attend and make the most of my subscription. 
* I want to get in touch with the company to find out more about the membership and evaluate if it is worth joining. 


2. _As a User Group two_:

* I want to learn which Operators have subscribed to determine if they are the right audience to promote my product.
* I want to know what competitors have subscribed so I can plan what to offer that will make my product stand out for my target audience.
* I want to know the dates of their upcoming events to see if I can participate and find out if there are places available. 
* I want to check out their social media channels to see how they promote the events and the subscription; this will allow me to evaluate if I should showcase with them.
* I want to get in touch with the company to find out more. 

 3. _As a User Group three_:

* I want to check out their social media channels to see how they promote the events and the subscription; this will allow me to evaluate if I should showcase with them.

### **2. Scope**

To achieve strategic goals, I have decided to include the following features: 

* **Header** that contains the company logo and the navigation bar.
* **Carousel** using pictures related to the Hospitality industry.
* **About us** section that provides knowledge about the company, this has pictures of three key directors of the company with a quote and image. It also has information about Who we are, what we do, and How we do it.
* **Our Members** Shows a small group of members telling about their experience using LinkedHospitality and a series of pictures showcasing all the members' logos.
* **Our Events** displays information about the events, dates and venues.
* **Get Linked** a contact form with the space to submit personal details, name, email, contact number, company and a drop-down button to choose the type of company.
* **Footer** contains links to social media, phone number and email.


### **3. Structure**

The structure idea is to reduce complexity and cognitive overload by creating a single-page website with a linear path containing all the ideal users' information and features. The navigation bar is located on the right and includes the links for all four sections of the page. The logo is on the left and brings the user back to the bottom of the page; this is an Industry standard that maintains familiarity and makes it easy to navigate when accessed for the first time. All the elements are discoverable and have content hinting by partially revealing parts of the following area just above the fold to encourage them to scroll down. 
I  have created the user flow strategically to encourage the user to keep scrolling down and unfolding information that will make them confident about the company and stimulate them to submit their details in the contact form. 


### **4. Skeleton**

**Wireframe** 

* [**Wireframes**](assets/wireframes/linkedhospitalitywireframes.pdf): I used Balsamiq to create a design with responsiveness on mobile and Ipad.  


## **Features**
***
*LinkedHospitality*  is a fully responsive website on all devices. It contains a Homepage with a carousel with related pictures, a header with links to the sections of the page, four sections: About us, Our members, Our Events, and Get Linked and a footer with links to social media platforms. 

* [**Home Page**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/): I have used Bootstrap Carousel to mate the page look more eye-catching with a series of pictures related to the Hospitality industry.
* [**Header**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/): The Header is a Navbar from Bootstrap containing a Logo and links to the rest of the sections. The get Linked button is particularly highlighted to encourage the user to press and submit their contact details. 
* [**About Us**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/#aboutus): in the About us section, I have added pictures of the directors of the company and below them information about "who we are", "What we do" and "How we do it" I have incorporated an icon from Font Awesome to each Title, so it enhances the meaning and follows the initial design. I have used Bootstrap's grid system to make that section responsive. I have incorporated three `col` that have two `row` inside, `row` one: with one `col-4` for pictures and one `col-8` for Quotes, `row` two: has one `col-12` for the Title and text.
* [**Our members**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/#ourmembers): in Our member's section, I have included pictures from some of the members with quotes of their experience with the company; I also added a Linkedin icon to each member for users to access their profile. I have used Bootstrap's Grid system again to make the information responsive; I have integrated a `row` with two `col-12` with each having two`row` inside, `Row` one: has a `col-6` for the picture and one `col-6` for the text, `Row` two: has a `col-12` for the quote underneath. I have used Font Awesome to add the icons. 
It has an area with the logos of some of its clients; those logos have links to their web pages. I have also used Bootstrap's Grid system to add responsiveness; it consists of a `container` with one `row` and six equally sized `col`.
* [**Our Events**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/#ourevents): In our Events section, I have included pictures and information about each event; I have used Bootstrap' Grid System to make the content responsive, it consists of four `row`, each one has two `col`, one for the text and one for the picture. I have located the information in a different order on the second and last row, so the image and the text appear on the left side.
* [**Get Linked**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/#getlinked):  On the GetLinked section, I have used Bootstrap's Grid system to make the form responsive. It consists of six `row` that are justified to the centre of the page; each `row` has two equally sized `col` where the `input` forms and `label` have been placed. 
* [**Footer**](https://mmestre21.github.io/LinkedHospitalityMS-1/#getlinked): On the Footer, I have also used two equally sized `col`, one for the copyright and the second for the icons with the links to social media. 

**Features left to implement**
* A gallery with images and videos of past events.
* A live calendar with all the events and seminars with date and time.

### **Testing on different Devises and Browsers**

I have tested the page using Chrome Developer's Tool and have tested in all the devices sizes available there; I also checked on the following:
* iPhone X
* Xiaomi Note 9 
* Samsung SM
* Samsung Galaxy Note 8   

I have also used different browsers: 
* Firefox
* Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Opera

Checked that all links are working and open on a different page, tried to submit the form and made sure that the `required` attribute was working. 

### **Project barriers and solutions**

* There were some issues with the grig system on the first section to make all the information response as the design; once I understood the grid system, I was able to figure out how to organize the `row` and `col` the correct way as explained on the features of the README.
* I added opacity to the `navbar-collapse`, but the colour wasn't changing; by using the development tools, I realized that the Navbar was taking over my rule because it was targetting the whole Navbar. After trying many things, I thought about changing the `height` to stay on that size; that made the Navbar not take over my rule and now has opacity when collapses.
### **Unsolved issues** 
* Navbar collapsing on mobile view is not bouncing back after clicking to an option.: I found a solution on Stackoverflow; after applying, the Navbar went back after clicking, but the links didn't work. After speaking with one of the Tutors, I found out that it can be done with JS that I will learn in the next chapter of the curse. This issue remains. 

### **Validation** 

I have used W3C [CSS Validator Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input):
![CSS validator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534058/112861485-bd526380-90ac-11eb-8106-9e3c4468419a.PNG)

I have used [W3C Markup Validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML:
![2nd testing HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534058/112861801-0b676700-90ad-11eb-9129-4686871b4595.PNG) 

### **Lighthouse** 
I have used Lighthouse to test the quality of the webpage; the scores are pretty high. However, I tried to fix the pictures sizes issue but still a more significant problem on mobile performance. 
* Scores on Desktop:
