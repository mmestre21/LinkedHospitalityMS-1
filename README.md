# LinkedHospitality

LinkedHospitality is a membership created for Hospitality Operators, suppliers and educational institutions in the UK.  Subscribing helps them to grow by staying connected with people in the industry by participating in their events.  The purpose of the events is to allow suppliers to showcase their products; Operators can find solutions for their business, share best practices and network with others in the industry; Educational institutions can offer their pieces of training. The membership allows all its users to gain new clients and make their product known.

The goal of the website is to provide information about LinkedHospitality membership with a layout and design that will facilitate the navigation to obtain the information required by the user that validates the company's reliability and trustworthiness leading the user to submit their contact details. 

This website is B2B, and the target audience is Hospitality operators, suppliers, educational institutions and new companies that want to get their product on the market.  The prominent users are general managers, Operation managers, Sales managers, Purchasing managers and  small companies CEOs.'

## UX

### 1. Strategy

**Business goals of the website:**

* To increase memberships by showcasing future events that encourage users to participate.
* To inform users about the current suppliers and hospitality companies that have successfully joined. 
* To enable users to submit their details when showing interest in the mebership. 
* To encourage suppliers and new technology solution companies to join the membership because they feel that members are the right target.   

**Customers goals of the website:**

* To validate their choice by seeing what the companies are part of the club.
* To research the company's reputation by looking at social media channels linked to the page.

* _Group two_: Suppliers: Food & beverage suppliers/furniture suppliers/venue suppliers/flower suppliers/linen suppliers/Property management systems suppliers.

**User Stories**

1. _As a user Group one_:

* I want to find out information about the company to determine if they have the expertise I am looking for.
* I want to see what suppliers have subscribed so I can determine whether will be valuable for my company to join.

* I want to find out the dates and location of their events to identify whether I will be able to attend and make the most of my subscription. 
* I want to get in touch with the company to find out more about the mem-bership and evaluate if is worth joining. 


2. _As a User Group two_:

* I want to know what competitors have subscribed so I can plan what to offer that will make my product stand out for my target audience.

### 2. Scope

To achieve strategic goals, I have decided to include the following features: 

* **Header** that contains the company logo and the navigation bar.
* **Carousel** using pictures related to the Hospitality industry.
* **About us** section that provides knowledge about the company, this has pictures of three key directors of the company with a quote and image. It also has information about Who we are, what we do, and How we do it.
* **Our Members** Shows a small group of members telling about their experience using LinkedHospitality and a series of pictures showcasing the logos of all the members.
* **Our Events** displays information about the events, dates and venues.
* **Get Linked** a contact form with the space to submit personal details, name, email, contact number, company and a drop-down button to choose the type of company.
* **Footer** it contains links to social media, phone number and email.


### 3. Structure

The structure idea is to reduce complexity and cognitive overload by creating a single-page website with a linear path that contains all the information and features required by the ideal users.  The navigation bar is located on the right and includes the links for all four sections of the page. The Logo is on the left and brings the user back to the bottom of the page; this is an Industry standard that maintains familiarity and makes it easy to navigate when accessed for the first time. All the elements are discoverable and have content hinting by partially revealing parts of the next area just above the fold to encourage the user to scroll down. 
I  have created the user flow strategically to encourage the user to keep scrolling down and unfolding information that will make them confident about the company and stimulate them to submit their details in the contact form.
